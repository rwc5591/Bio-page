            I am a Second-year pursuing Computing and Information Technology Degree at Rochester Institute of Technology. Currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computing and Information Technology. <em>"Information technology is found in every aspect of our lives: the workplace, our homes, the way we communicate, and in much of the entertainment we consume. IT professionals, therefore, are in great demand and highly valued. IT professionals are solution architects, identifying complex problems and creating custom solutions that help users meet their goals. They play an integral role in any modern organization, working on all phases of IT solutions from conception to development, testing, deployment, security, and management. In this information technology degree, you’ll learn to design, implement, and manage complex IT systems."</em> <cite>RIT Website</cite>
